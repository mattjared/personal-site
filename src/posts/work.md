<h3>NMRKT</h3>
<span>Marketing page design and development.</span>
<p>During the Techstars in Austin program I worked with NMRKT on a variety of different projects. Most notably, I redesigned and built their landing page. The new design has seen an increase in conversions and help communicate exactly what NMRKT stands for to potential customers, clients and investors. I designed the experience first, then moved into Photoshop for intricate details and later coded the site using Foundation and Sass.</p>

<h3>Fashion Metric</h3>
<span>Consumer marketing site design and development.</span>
<p>The team at Fashion Metric needed a new way to communicate their consumer facing site, Threadhound. I worked with the team to design and build a site that would encourage signups and communicate a sleek style matching the rest of their brand. I designed and built the site with Bootstrap using LESS.</p>

<h3>#tsmeterohack</h3>
<span>Meteor.js Application.</span>
<p>The Techstars program is known for pushing its participants beyond what they normally would think is possible. As a Hackstar with the program I worked with the teams to help with design and development in lots of ways. Many times, it was required to to learn new skills all together to complete a project. In that light, a few various team members and I met one Saturday and organized a hackathon around the JavaScript framework Meteor. I loosely followed a tutorial online and built a small app collecting all the participants at the hackathon. Designed with Bootstrap and hosted with Meteor hosting I learned how to build my first full stack single-page application.</p>

<h3>Cloud66</h3>
<span>Web App design and development</span>
<p>Cloud 66 is the best way to manage and deploy Ruby application to any stack. A SaaS product geared towards developers of all shapes and sizes need to be well supported by documentation for every nook and cranny of the application. Cloud 66 and I worked together to build out a community feature and presentation of their support docs. I worked directly with Cloud 66 CEO, Khash Sajadi, to build a a front end for a Rails application that will help drive their users to a better overall experience with Cloud 66.</p>

<h3>Morgan Linton</h3>
<span>COO of Fashion Metric</span>
<p>We had a great experience working with Matt. Our previous site looked great on a laptop or tablet but was cluttered and difficult to navigate on a smartphone. Matt built the new pages from scratch and went above-and-beyond to get the new site pixel perfect. Matt is an absolute CSS-wizard and a perfectionist, two things that happen to go very well together.</p>

<p>I've had the pleasure of working with Matt for over a year.

<h3>Claire Vo</h3>
<span>CEO of Experiment Engine</span>
<p>Matt helped us grow our business early on by providing high quality, quick turnaround design work for our customers. In addition, he went above and beyond for one of our customers (Massage.com) by turning around page variation designs quickly during a busy time of the program. He’s a very talented designer/developer, with an intense desire to learn and the best attitude of anyone I’ve worked with…ever. Work with Matt if you get the chance, he’s rad!</p>

<p>It has been a pleasure to work with Matt during Techstars. Beyond his amazing design and front end development skills Matt is a good hearted person.

<h3>Ryan Farley</h3>
<span>COO of Lawnstarter</span>
<p>Matt was incredibly helpful to us during the Techstars program.  He designed several physical advertisements and web banners for us which directly drove customer growth.  I knew better than to try and guide him since everything he produced was professional and better than we could have done on our own.  Matt is definitely an A player.</p>

<h3>Brandon Marker</h3>
<span>Analyst at Techstars</span>
<p>Matt is a sharp guy with a serious thirst for learning. Throughout the chaos of a 13 week Techstars program with 11 teams he helped us run the logistics of the program, advised companies on their front-end and design work, and actually designed sites and built investor/demo day decks for several teams. He’s an all-around badass.</p>
