## All my answers + a bunch of added context

â€¢ What is an iframe?
A box on a page that shows a window into another site. You may or may not control the other site but you can control that box window that shows it.

â€¢ What is Twitter Bootstrap? Why is shadcn different?
Boostrap! Spent A LOT of time with Bootstrap 3 and then Bootrsap 4 at the Zebra. It's a design library that you import (traditionally via a CDN file in your `<head>` to your app and use then use their html and css classes. Shadcn is different because it first uses only tailwind AND you basically copy paste the entire ownership of the component into your app. You own maintaining it forever and you don't overwrite existing styles like in Bootrsap. You control the ownership and can modify the output in a component or in the code you imported when you originally installed it/

â€¢ What is Big-O notation and why is it important?
This one goes slightly out of my exact understanding but it has to do with performance of your algorithms and how many round trips you need to take to complete a task. 

â€¢ What are the main differences between an array and a dictionary?
An array is an unorganized list `[]` and a dictionary is an object with properties that `{}`.
