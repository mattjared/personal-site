There are a lot of ways to render a web app. In a previous world it was only HTML, CSS and JS from a server. AJAX would alow us to render more data on the client. Better frameworks came around that made the data collection, mutation and display on the client much easier. Even better frameworks came around that made it even easier and solely pushed most of our workloads to the frontend. This added another layer of complexity and bloat to things but the adoption was so large and easy to adopt to the development community galvanized around this one framework. The big pitfall with only doing client renders is that performance can be really bad and the data fetched from a server was enormous. While the developer community adopted React they decided to also put it on the server. So most of the stuff you could only do in one place before you can now do it in both. So you could only do client stuff before, now you can also do server stuff. The complexity has grown so now we can have many different ways to RENDER stuff. I have several different pages below that allow us to understand rendering deeper...
