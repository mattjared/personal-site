Always start and end the day on a high note. It sometimes feels impossible to get over the hump of projects that take forever but the slow incremental progress and chaining together high notes will most likely get the project over the hump.

A high note doesn't have to be some Herculean all nighter. A high note to end the day, for me, would be to clear my desk, send a good evening message to my team on Slack and have four of my most pressing items written down for the next morning. Where I would, in a perfect world, pick off the first item and start the day on a high note.

This is imperfect and might not always be the key to finishing that nagging *thing* but sometimes, ending on a high note, no matter the muck you've encountered throughout the day will beget a high note the next morning.
