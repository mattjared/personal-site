A few very simple principals that I think are an idea to guide how to think about work and life.

## Enthusiasm is a choice

Energy is often dicated by different factors often completely out of our control. Enthusiasm, however is something we can control.

## Pursue perfection in fundamentals

Not having an answer for every question is how life and work just...are. Pursuing perfection of the fundamentals of your craft, current obsession, goals is really the aim.

## Pursuit > Perfection

Try. Give a shit. Take pride in your work. Have fun getting there.

## One day you'll be at a new job.

All yoru current colleagues will quit or be fired. You'll go somewhere new. What can this day teach you? How can I have an outsized impact on today?

That's it. If you are reading my blog for other-wordly wisdom maybe get outside or something. I don't know, you'll figure it out.
