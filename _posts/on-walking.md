Solvitur Ambulando, ‘It is solved by walking.'

The Sunday Tramps: A walking group https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/group/1319/Sunday%20Tramps

A lot of what I currently miss most about having a dog is having a chance to get out and walk.

Theologian and philosopher Soren Kierkegaard on the power of walking:

"Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. Even if one were to walk for one's health and it were constantly one station ahead—I would still say: Walk!

Besides, it is also apparent that in walking one constantly gets as close to well-being as possible, even if one does not quite reach it—but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Health and salvation can be found only in motion... if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right."
