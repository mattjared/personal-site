my absolute best year 
a year we lived in fear of the man with less of his ear 
but we found a way to enjoy the sun
found a way to find some fun 
explored and travelled and sought 
and but of course we also probably fought 
but to my one and only rivvy dear
this was my absolute best year 
you saw big cities and small alike
you learned to ride a bike 
we pushed and jumped and swam and saw
but sadly we all lost our most beloved dog 
but no doubt on my mind my rivvy dear 
i fear there will be no other year 
as good as the one we are closing now 
i end with this small vow 
to aim to repeat what we had this year
