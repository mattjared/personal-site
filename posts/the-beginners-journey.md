# Beginners Journey

Sources: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)

In 1974 a young filmaker become friends with an author who had recently claimed that all stories were the same. No matter the setting, plot, characters, subplots, outcome and critical or commercial success. All stories that anyone has heard or would tell were actually all the exact same. The young filmmaker took head of the authors claims and crafted his next film around a framework the author had coined known as "The Hero's Journey". The filmmaker's next project followed the Hero's Journey framework to a T. The filmmaker's name was George Lucas and then next story he would tell was eventually released as Star Wars.

The success of Star Wars goes beyond financial, it is culturally one of the most important pieces of work that maybe has ever been released. Scores of creators in over the 40 years since it was released have taken their turn with The Hero's Journey and continued to affect our society today. People focus their entire identity around how much they love the story of Luke Skywalker and his band of misfit friends and all the ensuring intellectual property that has been spun off from the originals.

The Hero's Journey framekwork has undoubtedbly inspired all of us to some degree at some point. We walk out of a movie theater or put down a completed book and think that we too can go achieve our dareams like the protagonists in the stories we interact with. The framework provided by the mythos is simple...

tk, annotate this with funny stuff
4.1.1 The Call to Adventure
4.1.2 Refusal of the Call
4.1.3 Supernatural Aid
4.1.4 The Crossing of the First Threshold
4.1.5 Belly of the Whale
4.2 Initiation
4.2.1 The Road of Trials
4.2.2 The Meeting with the Goddess
4.2.3 Woman as the Temptress
4.2.4 Atonement with the Father/Abyss
4.2.5 Apotheosis
4.2.6 The Ultimate Boon
4.3 Return
4.3.1 Refusal of the Return
4.3.2 The Magic Flight
4.3.3 Rescue from Without
4.3.4 The Crossing of the Return Threshold
4.3.5 Master of the Two Worlds

Does this feel familier? Almost all mythological stories follow the same framework. Hero gets the call. They go do the thing. They come back. Everyone is happy.

Using this same framework is often how we motivate ourselves. "I can go the distance!" "Use the force!" "Let it go!" "Everybody wang chung tonight!"

But as the day-to-day grind of doing new things or building new habits or boldly going where noone has gone before it's actually a lot harder to be the hero than we give ourselves credit for. Since we're all, naturally, the heros in our own stories some of our stories aren't quite stacked up the same way. The supernatural aid or helper or guardian might not be available today (Covid exposure, give 'em 10 days and then maybe go on your journey?) As evidenced by centuries of racist government misalignment some transformations and atonements will never be possible given a cysephean level of day-to-day responsibility shouldered by non white males in our society.

The point being, oftentimes our heros shoulder through adversity, just because. "The Ring chose me", "Voldemort's soul actually just happens to be inside of me so that's why I can beat him", "Turns out Darth Vader is my dad?! Holy shit! I guess I'm the most powerful space wizard of all time too, sweet."

In 2012 I packed up my mom's car and moved from Cincinnati, Ohio to Austin, Texas. Yeehaw! I wanted to work with startups and be a software engineer. I was prescribing to the Hero's Journey model. I'd enter into the unknown and somehow things would work out. Things did work out for me but on a far far slower pace and I'm not going to act like a gigantic pile of white privelage and ableism didn't help push me through when i could have easily been handed my ass on a platter.

It unrealistic our day-to-day lives to assume that the Hero's Journey is actually applicable to us. I moved to Austin in 2012 hoping to work with startups and become a software engineer. It took me 3 full years to get a full time role as a developer. I thought, just because I would try hard, somebody would give me a shot. The space wizard in a cloak who would teach me everything and draw out these amazing skills from within me that I didn't know I had never showed up. I didn't learn anything special about myself, I just got lucky and stumbled upon a small framework that may or may not be a way to achieve things.

But there's hope that The Hero's Journey can still inspire and motivuate us to pull more from ourselves and ascend to the next level beyond the known of our current situations.

As mentioned previously, I moved to Austin to learn to code and work with startups and all that. I was tremendously naive in a way only a young person could be that I could move somewhere learn a new skill become weathly both financially and in life. All of that did happen but not in the way I thought it would. Before I could enter the unknown I had to know it was actually possible to do what I wanted to do.

When I first moved to Austin it was the week of SXSW. A huge music, film and technology conference that engulfs the whole city. I saw people trying to launch startups. I actually started seeing people who were doing what I wanted to do. Before I decided to move I had spent my lunch hours at a previous job reading startup blogs and learning about who was doing what in Austin. I was sitting at a Wendy's in Cheviot, Ohio when I read about Wahooly. A something or other platform that promised to do great things. Several months later at a party at the App Sumo office I met the entire Wahooly team just hanging out. They were right there. I was takling to them. I have no clue what ever happened to Wahooly but I walked away seeing actual people who wrote the software that powered their ocmpany. THey weren't mythical things in space that nobody could explain. This led me to my first finding of the Beginner's Journey...the belief that it's possible.
