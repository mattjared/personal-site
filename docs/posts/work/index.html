            <span>Marketing page design and development.</span>
            <p>During the Techstars in Austin program I worked with NMRKT on a variety of different projects. Most notably, I redesigned and built their landing page. The new design has seen an increase in conversions and help communicate exactly what NMRKT stands for to potential customers, clients and investors. I designed the experience first, then moved into Photoshop for intricate details and later coded the site using Foundation and Sass.</p>

            <p>The team at Fashion Metric needed a new way to communicate their consumer facing site, Threadhound. I worked with the team to design and build a site that would encourage signups and communicate a sleek style matching the rest of their brand. I designed and built the site with Bootstrap using LESS.</p>

            <p>The Techstars program is known for pushing its participants beyond what they normally would think is possible. As a Hackstar with the program I worked with the teams to help with design and development in lots of ways. Many times, it was required to to learn new skills all together to complete a project. In that light, a few various team members and I met one Saturday and organized a hackathon around the JavaScript framework Meteor. I loosely followed a tutorial online and built a small app collecting all the participants at the hackathon. Designed with Bootstrap and hosted with Meteor hosting I learned how to build my first full stack single-page application.</p>

            <p>Cloud 66 is the best way to manage and deploy Ruby application to any stack. A SaaS product geared towards developers of all shapes and sizes need to be well supported by documentation for every nook and cranny of the application. Cloud 66 and I worked together to build out a community feature and presentation of their support docs. I worked directly with Cloud 66 CEO, Khash Sajadi, to build a a front end for a Rails application that will help drive their users to a better overall experience with Cloud 66.</p>

Matt built the new pages from scratch and went above-and-beyond to get the new site pixel perfect. Matt is an absolute CSS-wizard and a perfectionist, two things that happen to go very well together.</p>

He’s a very talented designer/developer, with an intense desire to learn and the best attitude of anyone I’ve worked with…ever. Work with Matt if you get the chance, he’s rad!</p>
