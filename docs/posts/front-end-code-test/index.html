			<h2>Front End Code Test</h2>
			<h5>Posted on: Sept 1, 2021</h5>
			<p>Here's a series of front end code tests that I published on Code Sandbox. Take a look and feel free to use these when interviewing front end candidates. See the README's in the Sandboxes for more details.</p>
      <p>WARNING: The instructions below and in the CodeSandboxes are imperfect and nebulous. I’ll be in the room interviewing people and I’d like to work with them to see how they think and try to understand their experience level. If anyone wants more thorough instructions and final requirements for interviewees then please ping me.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/cdhzo" target="_blank">Part 1</a></h2>
      <p>In this portion of the test we want to warm up and solve some easy problems.</p>
      <p>Time allotment:<strong>10 mins</strong></p> 
      <p>Requirements:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Import all the data from data.js</li>
        <li>Create a new component and pass the data to it as a prop</li>
        <li>Show only the Tracks in this new component</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/zqkd5" target="_blank">Part 2</a></h2>
      <p>In this portion we want to work on adding interactivity and displaying dynamic data.</p>
      <p>Time allotment:<strong>20 mins</strong></p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the existing components to show selected data</li>
        <li>Pass functions as props</li>
        <li>Manage state in App.js</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/o6vzx" target="_blank">Part 3</a></h2>
      <p>Finally, we will work on styling some markup using whatever CSS methodology we want.</p>
      <p>Time allotment:<strong>15 mins</strong></p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the design as inspiration</li>
        <li>Looking for basic knowledge here</li>
        <li>Getting to adding an active class and styling that properly would be great</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/udm3j">Completed Solution</a></h2>
      <p>This isn’t an all encompassing solution nor is it perfect but it will be a good tool to share with candidates so they
      know how to manage apps like this in the future. If there’s ever a point where something in the previous parts doesn’t
      make sense we can easily jump to this and work around some other problems.</p>
